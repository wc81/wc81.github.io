论文摘要
======
Data-driven process monitoring methods have attracted many attentions and gained wide applications. However, the real industrial process data are much more complex which is characterized by multimode, high dimensional, corrupted, and less labeled data. In order to eliminate these unfavourable factors simultaneously, a semisupervised robust projective and discriminative dictionary learning method is proposed. First, a semisupervised strategy is introduced to label unsupervised training data. Then, by utilizing low-rank and sparse features of raw data and outliers, a robust decomposition method is used to obtain clean data. After that, a simultaneously projective and discriminative model is proposed to extracting the feature of the low-rank clean data. Finally, the projection matrix and global dictionary, as well as the threshold are obtained through iterative dictionary learning. This hybrid framework provides a robust model for process monitoring and mode identification, and its efficiency is demonstrated by both synthetic examples and real industrial process cases.
