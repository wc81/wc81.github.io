论文摘要
======
Crowd-inspired intelligent manufacturing space (CrowdIM) aims to leverage the aggregated power of heterogeneous human–machine–things (HMT) agents for improving the efficiency of intelligent manufacturing. A significant scientific problem in CrowdIM is how to improve individual skills and crowd intelligence through cooperation, complementation, competition, and confrontation among HMT agents. The emergence mechanism of biological crowd intelligence provides an inspiration to address this challenge. This article explores the mapping mechanisms between natural crowd intelligence and CrowdIM, from the aspects, such as collective dynamics, self-adaptive mechanism, crowd intelligence optimization, graph structure mapping model, evolutionary game dynamics, multiagent learning, and so on. We further propose a general model of CrowdIM and expound it through a typical case study.
